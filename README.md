A game created for the Ludum Dare 34 game jam, with the themes 'growing' and 'two button controls'. I decided I wanted to work with l-system procedural tree generation.

While it's far from being a good, finished game, it was a good learning experience. As well as working out how to implement l-systems, it was my first real experience working with Luxe, a powerful but poorly documented 2D entity-component model game engine for Haxe.
